# IFS Cloud and PSO
This github repository is meant to showcase how you can work with IFS Cloud and PSO using Python. 
<b>This is not official/standard code from IFS and I am not a python developer and the code</b>. This not meant to be used in production or provide example of best practices in coding but rather showing: 
1. how you can leverage Python to extract data and analyze them in PSO
2. how you can retrieve information from IFS Cloud using API
3. how create and release work orders in IFS Cloud

In the <i>/notebooks</i> folder you can find a collection of jupiter workbooks I have used in the past while in the <i>/projects</i> one  you can find examples of more structured applications I have developed for my own use.

<b>Current Projects</b>
1. IFS Cloud Data Loader: to load mass data into IFS Cloud from files (based on the notebook 30 - IFS Cloud Create Work Order)
